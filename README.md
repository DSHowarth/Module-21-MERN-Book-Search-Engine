# Module-21-MERN-Book-Search-Engine

## Description

This is a simple website that lets you search for books using Google's API. And if you log in,
you can save a list of books to reference later. I didn't write most of that, however. My work here
was to convert this functionality from using a RESTful API to use Apollo and GraphQL. In an ideal world,
it'll work exactly like the starter code.

## Lessons Learned
- It can be very frustrating when you need to change a lot of code, and are unable to test individual pieces
as you go. 
- If you try to assign a variable by referencing something that's undefined, it won't just give that variable the value
of undefined. It'll crash instead.
